# Create a class called Greeting with a single method called greet that takes a string argument and prints that argument to the terminal.

# Now create two other classes that are derived from Greeting: one called Hello and one called Goodbye. The Hello class should have a hi method that takes no arguments and prints "Hello". The Goodbye class should have a bye method to say "Goodbye". Make use of the Greeting class greet method when implementing the Hello and Goodbye classes - do not use any puts in the Hello or Goodbye classes.

class Greeting
  def greet(msg)
    puts msg
  end
end

class Hello < Greeting
  def hi
    greet('Hello')
  end
end

class Goodbye < Greeting
  def bye
    greet('Goodbye')
  end
end

hi = Hello.new
hi.hi

gb = Goodbye.new
gb.bye
